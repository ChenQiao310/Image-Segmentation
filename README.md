# Image-Segmentation

In the last few years, a number of neural networks for image segmentation have been designed with considerable success. 
One of the most prominent attempts was the U-Net by Ronneberger et al. (2015).
In this project, I implemented the U-net architecture for cell image data segmentation using PyTorch and use weights and biases to cleanly logged the training loss, validation loss, hyperparameters, etc.
